Proteins play a fundamental role in effectively all metabolic pathways and thus
are at the heart of molecular biology and biochemistry.
The function of a protein is directly related to its structure, determined by
the series of folds that occur along the sequence of amino acids comprising the
protein [@Fis09].
Knowledge of protein structure also has important implications for evolutionary
biology.
Specifically, because structure is conserved more strongly than molecular
sequence [@Fis09], structural information makes it possible to accurately
determine the evolutionary relationships between distantly related species
[@Her+14].
However, the technical difficulties in experimentally determining the structure
of a protein have created a rapidly growing gap between the total number of
sequenced proteins and those with a known structure [@LWZ09; @MHS12].
@LWZ09 suggested that structural prediction *in silico* is the only way to
close this gap.

@Fis09 summarised the computational approaches to protein structure prediction
as using either the laws of physics (*ab initio* methods) or the theory of
evolution (comparative, template-based methods).
However, @Lup08 emphasised that the true solution to this problem is *ab
initio* given the limited usefulness of comparative methods to make accurate
predictions, especially in the absence of substantial prior information.
It is worth noting that ths dichotomy is less clear-cut in practice: many
otherwise *ab inito* methods do take advantage of the knowledge in databases
[@Fis09; @LWZ09; @ZS11; @XZ12] and template-based methods still rely on physics
for refinement as it is impossible to make accurate predictions solely based on
homology [@Fis09; @Rav+12].

The ideal approach to structure prediction would be full simulation of protein
synthesis and folding at the atomic level relying only on quantum mechanics and
the fundamental laws of physics [@LWZ09].
Furthermore, such simulations could yield important insights into the folding
process itself, which is equally complex and varies even between proteins with
homologous structure [@Lup08].
However, due to the immense computational resources necessary for its
implementation, little serious effort has been made in this area [@LWZ09].
Proteins are generally modelled on the atomic level, where each atom is
represented by three coordinates (either using the Cartesian system or the
torsion-angle system), such that a protein model consisting of $n$ atoms has
$3\left(n-1\right)$ degrees of freedom [@XZ12].
For example, the beta subunit of haemoglobin consists of nearly 5000 atoms for
some 15000 degrees of freedom [@Kav+98].
The number of atoms also provides a lower bound on the number of particles
considered in an accurate physical model, which must also model the solvent.
Unfortunately it is infeasible to complete the calculations necessary for a
complete simulation on a realistic time scale.

This limitation forces the use of various approximations in the form of
mathematical, statistical, and computational techniques.
From this perspective, the protein structure prediction problem is framed
as an optimisation problem where the key challenges are deriving a scoring
function that gives the best score to the true structure and developing a
search algorithm that can find this structure with the optimal score [@LWZ09].
The correct structure is assumed to be the most thermodynamically stable one
and thus structures are scored according to an energy function [@Fis09;
@LWZ09].
Both physics- and knowledge-based energy functions are used for this purpose
[@LWZ09; @ZS11].

To make computations feasible, an energy function should ideally reduce the
number of independent particles being considered.
Modelling the protein *in vacuo* is an easy but poor-performing approximation
[@LWZ09] due to the significance of water-mediated interactions in protein
folding [@Dav+12].
Instead, a coarse-grained force field can systematically reduce the number of
particles in the model without ignoring important interactions by using the
average energy over the neglected degrees of freedom
[@Mai+10].
Each residue is generally represented by the atoms in its backchain (or some
approximation, as in the UNRES model) and the centre of mass of its side chain
[@LWZ09; @Dav+12].
Both the UNRES [@Mai+10] and AWSEM [@Dav+12] models are examples of
coarse-grained energy functions that are primarily physics-based but are
augmented with knowledge from the PDB (although a later development of UNRES
replaces these knowledge-based terms with additional physics-based terms).
The AWSEM energy function includes terms for the bond lengths and angles of the
backbone, the placement of the side chain, the interactions between neighboring
amino acid residues and water, and the propensity for a particular residue to
be within or on the outside of the protein [@Dav+12].
The GOAP [@ZS11], QUARK [@XZ12], and I-TASSER [@Yan+15] energy functions are,
on the other hand, primarily knowledge-based.
The information for these methods comes from structural regularities as
determined empirically from known experimental structures in the PDB
[@XZ12; @Yan+15].
Notably, all of the terms used in QUARK are in fact physically-motivated
despite being computed statistically [@XZ12].

With an energy function in hand, it remains only to find the best model.
Parameter optimisation is a well-studied problem with several existing
methodologies.
The main techniques used for protein structure prediction include Monte Carlo
(with simulated annealing) [@Fis09; @LWZ09; @NJ12; @XZ12; @Yan+15] and
molecular dynamics simulations
[@Lup08; @Fis09; @LWZ09; @Mar+11; @Dav+12; @Rav+12; @MNF14; @Mai+10].
Molecular dynamics strategies are especially suited for structure refinement
[@Rav+12].
Other optimisation strategies, such as genetic algorithms, have been applied
to structure prediction [@LWZ09; @Fis09] but appear to be less popular or
successful [@Mou+14].
Searching for the optimal structure is difficult because the "landscape"
defined by the energy function is rugged, causing algorithms to become stuck
in local minima [@LWZ09].
Search strategies benefit from an approximate model of the protein stucture
that reduce the degrees of freedom and, therefore, the total space of
structures to be searched [@XZ12].

Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics algorithms differ in the amount of change
that occurs in a single iteration and are thus best applied in different
situations.
In a molecular dynamics simulation, the protein structure at any given time
can be found by solving Newton's equations of motions, with the idea that
after enough time the protein will be in its most thermodynamically stable
state [@LWZ09].
However, because there is no explicit solution, numerical integration must be
used instead.
Thus, each iteration of the simulation is generally on the order of
femtoseconds (one quadrillionth of a second) [@LWZ09].
Given that a complete simulation takes milliseconds, trillions of iterations
of the molecular dynamics algorithm become necessary [@LWZ09].
Each iteration involves computing the derivative, or slope, of the energy
function at that point with respect to every degree of freedom.
This requirement restricts either the complexity of the energy function,
as it must be analytically differentiable, or increases the computational
effort if numerical differentiation is used instead.
On the other hand, Monte Carlo algorithms use large proposals to rapidly
traverse the state space.
The Monte Carlo algorithm samples structures according to the energy function
at a given temperature, so for the algorithm to settle at the optimal structure
the temperature is gradually lowered [@LWZ09].
This procedure is known as simulated annealing [@LWZ09].
Although Monte Carlo with simulated annealing is not a greedy algorithm due
to its use of the Metropolis criterion, if the algorithm is exploring a local
optimum when the temperature is decreased then it will very likely get stuck at
that local optimum.
Replica-exchange is a flavour of Monte Carlo that builds on simulated annealing
and is used in QUARK, I-TASSER, and Rosetta [@SW86; @XZ12; @Yan+15].
Unlike the standard Monte Carlo algorithm, the replica-exchange algorithm
involves simultaneous simulation at different temperatures of several replicas
of the model [@SW86], with more replicas used for larger proteins [@Yan+15].
Periodically, a global swap of model features between the replicas is
attempted [@Yan+15].
The use of multiple simulations and exchanges between these simulations helps
to prevent the algorithm from getting stuck in a local optimum.

Even with sophisticated search algorithms finding the optimal structure
remains very difficult.
Template-based prediction aggressively reduces the search space by applying
the assumption that a small change in sequence should only cause a small change
in structure [@Fis09].
The first steps for these methods involve searching through the PDB for
homologous structures and deciding which parts of these to use, if any
[@Fis09].

However, template-based prediction neglects non-homologous fragments in the
protein.


It is important to note that no search algorithm can compensate for a poor
scoring function, as its responsibility is only to find the best-scoring
structure by that function.
Improvements to the search algorithm only affect the speed of prediction and
the probability that the best-scoring structure is found and not necessarily
that the accuracy of the prediction improves [@MNF14].
Furthermore, @Rav+12 suggested that inaccurate force fields are the limiting
factor in protein structure prediction because they found that refinement using
molecular dynamics simulations caused the model to move away from the true
structure.
Accordingly, most of the recent advances in protein structure prediction are
primarily focused on improving the energy functions used to score and rank
structures.

The refinement of protein structure predictions is a recent area of notable
advances [@Mou+14].

It is clear that no matter what approach is taken to the protein structure
prediction problem there is still substantial progress to be made.
Although *ab initio* methods are performing better than ever, they still
struggle to scale for larger proteins [@Mou+14].

Perhaps the greatest challenge in evaluating advances in protein structure
prediction is that it is difficult to establish how much of the recent progress
in protein structure prediction are truly due to intellectual achievements in
method design [@KFM14].
Both the amount of computational power available and the number of
experimentally determined structures have increased substantially in the last
decade.
Because these advances improve our ability to accurately predict structures
it is difficult to perform fair comparisons.
