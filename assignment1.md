 1. In the highest resolution shell the data quality is quite poor, with only
    $75\%$ completeness at a fairly decent $2.8$ times redundancy.
    The $R_{merge} = 0.413$ is appropriate following traditional identification
    of the highest resolution shell, although likely suffers from the known
    bias when considering a low multiplicity dataset such as this one.
    Furthermore, no $<I\sigma I>$ value is reported, which is hardly reassuring
    of the data quality.

 2. The $R_{cryst} = 0.2080$ seems reasonable for this dataset, although the
    $R_{free} = 0.2930$ is somewhat higher than would be ideal, alerting us to
    the likely presence of significant errors in the model.

 3. The $B$-factors are very high ($>100$) throughout the length of Chains B
    and C that represent the SbII peptide substrate. These $B$-factors convey
    that there is substantial uncertainty with regard to the structure of SbII,
    whether due to molecular disorder or errors with the model.

 4. The Ramachandran plot statistics produced by MolProbity are most definitely
    alarming. For Chain A representing the neurotoxin, MolProbity highlights
    the less-than-ideal percentages of Ramachandran outliers and favored
    ($2.36\%$ and $91.25\%$, respectively); however, the values are still in
    the general ballpark, placing it in the 34th percentile on MolProbity.
    These statistics suggest at the very least an imperfect model.
    For Chains B and C representing the SbII substrate the statistics are much
    worse: some $34.38\%$ of the atoms are outliers and only $31.25\%$ are
    favored, placing it in the 0th percentile on MolProbity and alerting us to
    serious issues with the model.

 5. The large number of outliers in the Ramachandran plots for Chains B and C
    implies that the conformation of the SbII peptide is energetically
    unfavourable. Although this often indicates a poor model, there may also be
    some biochemical explanations for this model. For example, it could be that
    when cleaved by and bound to the protease, the SbII substrate assumes
    this unfavourable conformation.

 6. The electron density maps generally appear to support the model for the
    the protease, as based on a visual inspection of their overall agreement.
    However, the electron density map is virtually non-existent for the
    substrate and therefore can lend no support for its model.

 7. Overall, I would rate the quality of this structure and the associated data
    as not ready for publication. The data are incomplete and show significant
    uncertainty for the SbII substrate, which is an important part of the model.
    Furthermore, several questions can be raised with regard to the model
    creation and refinement process, given the less-that-ideal cross-validation
    results and Ramachandran statistics. The SbII substrate in particular is
    lacking any sort of supported model. Although there are potential biochecmial
    explanations, at the current data quality it would be difficult to make any
    well-supported claims.

 8. I think that we should be quite hesitant to attempt to draw any conclusions
    from this structure with regard to how the neurotoxin binds and cleaves SbII.
    The poor model reconstruction for the SbII substrate greatly hinders our
    ability to appreciate the features of this process and I feel
    it would be very misguided to make any claims based on this work.
