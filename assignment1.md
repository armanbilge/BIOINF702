Q1. The data approach the ideal quality at $90.1\%$ completeness and $2.9$ times redundancy. The $R_\text{merge} = 0.055$ and $<I\sigma(I)> = 20$ seem quite good. However, in the higest resolution shell, completeness falls to $75\%$ and the $R_\text{merge} = 0.413$, below acceptable values, while the redundancy is still decent at $2.8$ times.

Q2. $R_free = 0.239$ 

Q3.
